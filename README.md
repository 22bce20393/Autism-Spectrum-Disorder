# ðŸ§  Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification

This project focuses on classifying Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using facial image data. It uses both **transfer learning (VGG16, InceptionV3)** and a **hybrid approach** involving traditional ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
